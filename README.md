## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
* **PNPM** (`npm install -g pnpm`)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anandpskerala/ArticleHubFrontend.git
    cd ArticleHubFrontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

If your backend API is not running on the default expected URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`), you might need to configure an environment variable. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

*Replace `http://localhost:5000/api` with the actual base URL of your ArticleHubBackend API.*

### Running the Application

**Development Mode:**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development server, typically accessible at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is in use). It includes hot module replacement for a smooth development workflow.

**Production Mode:**

1. **Build the project:**

```bash
pnpm build
```

2. **Preview the production build (optional):**
```bash
pnpm preview
```
